# Student-Performance
This project aims to analyze factors affecting student test scores using a dataset that includes hours of study, sleep, attendance rate, and participation level. The goal is to explore how these factors correlate with student performance and to derive meaningful insights for educators and learners.

## Dataset Features
StudentID : Unique ID for each student

StudyHours : Average number of hours studied per day

SleepHours : Average number of hours of sleep per day

AttendanceRate : Class attendance rate (percentage)

Participation : Level of class participation (numerical scale)

TestScore : Final test score (0–100)

## Project Goals
Analyze how study habits and lifestyle affect test scores

Determine correlations between features like sleep and performance

## Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Data analysis and visualization) 

Libraries: Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical computing), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

## Key Analysis Areas

Correlation between StudyHours and TestScore

Impact of SleepHours on academic performance

Relationship between AttendanceRate and TestScore

How Participation influences performance

Visualize data trends using plots and graphs

## Conclusion

Positive correlation between StudyHours and TestScore

Students with better AttendanceRates tend to score higher

SleepHours has a moderate influence — not too little, not too much

Participation is also positively associated with better scores
